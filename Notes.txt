Move all providers to a separate file. under /providers/. 

Fix lyric syncing

Move Spotify API to a separate file and use it only for artist/title. 

Simplify the code. 

Simplify system_utils to make it faster. 













---


Some features I plan to implement:

```
- Better handling of network timeouts
```

- Add Musixmatch provider (they have high-quality synced lyrics) 
- Add QQ Music provider (good for Asian music)

Add any other synced lyrics providers that you know of. 


```
- Parallel provider fetching
- Smart provider ordering based on success rate
- Cache provider statistics to prioritize faster/more reliable ones
```



```
- Better song title/artist matching using fuzzy matching
```


```
- Add lyrics source attribution in UI
- Show loading states while fetching lyrics
- Provider preference settings in UI
```

These should be done only if minimal=true isn't set. 
That is, in minimal mode, I want just the lyrics with a clean look, as in the image. 
In normal mode, we can add more info. There should also be a button for minimal mode. 

Some more things:

1) Download and store all lyric files in a directory, with one file per song. 

So we have an organized database of lyrics. 

We want a high-quality database of lyrics.  With perfect syncs. 

This database will be referred to when possible, so it will work better. 

2) Add an option to change the background of the UI. 

Different color options, gradients, 

and also be able to add the album art or an album-art-color-gradient.
